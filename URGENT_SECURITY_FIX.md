# ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY FIX - Data Isolation Issue

## Problem
Users can see each other's clients, projects, and data. This is a critical security vulnerability.

## Immediate Action Required

### Step 1: Apply the Security Fix
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor**
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase/fix-rls-policies.sql`
4. **RUN THE QUERY IMMEDIATELY**

### Step 2: Verify the Fix Works
1. In Supabase SQL Editor, run the test script from `supabase/test-security.sql`
2. Verify that:
   - `rowsecurity` is `true` for all tables
   - You only see YOUR data counts
   - The ownership test shows "YOUR DATA âœ“" only

### Step 3: Test in Your Application
1. Log in with your original account
2. Check that you only see your clients/projects
3. Log in with the new account you created
4. Verify it shows NO clients/projects (empty state)
5. Create a test client with the new account
6. Switch back to original account - you should NOT see the new client

## What Was Wrong

1. **Row Level Security policies** weren't properly filtering by `user_id`
2. **Helper functions** weren't adding explicit user filters
3. **Authentication context** might not have been properly applied

## What the Fix Does

1. **Drops all existing policies** and recreates them with proper user filtering
2. **Adds explicit user_id checks** to all RLS policies
3. **Updates helper functions** to double-check user ownership
4. **Adds verification queries** to test the security

## Critical Security Rules Now Enforced

- âœ… Users can ONLY see their own clients
- âœ… Users can ONLY see their own projects  
- âœ… Users can ONLY see their own documents
- âœ… Users can ONLY see timelines for their projects
- âœ… Users can ONLY modify their own data
- âœ… All operations require authentication

## Test Results Should Show

**Before Fix:**
```sql
-- BAD: Shows other users' data
SELECT count(*) FROM clients; -- Returns ALL users' clients
```

**After Fix:**
```sql  
-- GOOD: Shows only your data
SELECT count(*) FROM clients; -- Returns only YOUR clients
```

## If the Fix Doesn't Work

1. Check that you're logged in when running the test queries
2. Verify all policies were created (check `pg_policies` table)
3. Make sure RLS is enabled on all tables
4. Try logging out and back in to refresh the session

## Prevention for Future

- Always test data isolation when adding new tables
- Use the security test script regularly
- Never skip RLS policies for new tables
- Always add explicit user_id filters in application code

## ðŸ”’ This fix is CRITICAL - Apply it immediately!
